Description=Creative Pebble V1 2.0 Speakers (Acoustic-Electronic, WellBeSerious)EQ Type: Custom, not frequency response/hearing test.Explanation: This equalization is tuned for best balance between least distortion, clarity ('tighter'frequencies), and best sounding over time (goal: melody, least pain/fatigue over time). CreativePebble V1's sound signature is best described as weak-bass Lofi. I started at a flat graph. Sincemost frequencies' loudness/volume wasn't too far off what I'd recommend, I skipped 'mean averaging'all values. I lastly adjusted 'pre-amplifying' value. -15db is between -30db (lowest limit) and 0db(default). 0 is too bassy/distorted, -30 is too trebbly (VERY sharp frequencies at times), and -15dbis literally in-between and a perfect balance of treble and bass. Otherwise treble and bass areconstantly overtaking the other and being either too harsh or too distorted. This way both 'cancel'each other out (to the hardware's best ability). This is EQ 1 of 2, meant for Acoustic and Electronicmusic. If you want stronger/more distorted bass, choose EQ 2 (Gothic). This is the tradeoff with theselackluster speakers.(Frequency)	(Original)(Tuned)Pre-amplifying: 0db	15db10hz		0db	0db21hz		0db	-1db42hz		0db	+0.5db83hz		0db	+0.5db166hz		0db	-0.5db333hz		0db	+0.5db577hz		0db	+0.5db1000hz		0db	-1db2000hz		0db	-0.5db4000hz		0db	+1db8000hz		0db	-1db16000hz		0db	-0.5db20000hz		0db	-1dbCreator: WellBeSerious
